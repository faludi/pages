Wabi-sabi is a Japanese aesthetic and worldview that embraces the beauty of imperfection, impermanence, and simplicity. It finds value in the natural, the humble, and the flawed.

The dehumanizing mechanization of modern life has led to stress, busywork, invasive thoughts, anxiety, and depression. Each new electronic invention seems to take us further from the natural world, and into a more rigidly ordered state. We are confronted by millisecond timings and deterministic procedures, leaving  us scrambling to attain a precision and perfection that’s always slightly beyond our grasp. The devices we create are cool and sleek, with right angles and crisp corners. This makes them easier to manufacture and transport, but unnatural for the end user to hold and operate. Many modern devices require forms of interaction that are more suited to a industrial robot than a human person. Tiny buttons, confusing indicators and hidden operations frustrate the user, sometimes making them feel inadequate, overwhelmed and unworthy.

But it doesn’t have to be this way! By designing with humane intent, guided by wabi-sabi, we can create digital and physical experiences that nourish the soul and feed the human spirit. We can come closer to nature, improve our outlook, ease our worries and regain our peace of mind.

Despite having an allure of mystery, wabi-sabi is actually very accessible. Electronics too may appear baffling, yet experience shows that almost anyone can master the basics with only brief instruction. In both, a novice with only a superficial understanding can begin with rudimentary steps that produce immediate benefits. Flaws and imperfections in that novice’s practice don’t ruin it. In fact as you will see, imperfections can and should be celebrated—such blemishes are actually core to the wabi-sabi philosophy itself. The benefits begin immediately, with skills and understanding deepening and becoming richer over time.
