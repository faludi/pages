We recently spent some time in the [Japanse Friendship Garden](https://www.japanesefriendshipgarden.org) in Phoenix, Arizona. It's a quiet green refuge in a busy, hot, beige city that often surpasses 120ºF in the summer. Here's a description of the garden from their web site:

> The Japanese Friendship Garden, named Rohoen (鷺鳳園), is a joint project of the City of Phoenix and our Sister City Himeji, Japan. Himeji Mayor, Matsuji Totani proposed the garden in 1987 to cement the bonds of friendship between Japan and the United States and particularly between the peoples of Himeji and Phoenix. 
>The teahouse and surrounding tea garden were completed in November 1996, the 20th anniversary of our Sister City relationship. The project features a stroll garden, tea garden, and a dry garden. All the decorative features that you see in the garden and the thousands of hours required to design and guide its construction are gifts from the City of Himeji and its citizens.

In the photos below, look for nature shaped in collaboration with human hands, rich contextual design, asymmetries, peaceful spaces and even a tea house whose current Master is Dr. Sen Soshitsu, the former tea master of the Urasenke School of Tea in Japan. Dr. Sen is a _15th_ generation descendant of [Sen no Rikyū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_no_Rikyū) (千利休 1521-1591), who is widely regarded as the first and most important Japanese tea master.
