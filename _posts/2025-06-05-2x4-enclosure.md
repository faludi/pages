 Ben Light recycled scrap 2x4 lumber to make a more organic and humane housing for his electronic projects.
 
 Electronic devices almost always require an enclosure to protect sensitive components from physical contact and hide visually unappealing circuitry. These enclosures tend to be injection-molded plastic boxes that are resilient, low-cost and utterly cold to the senses. Ben, an ITP colleague of mine, thought recycling scrap would not only have environmental benefits, but also speak to the user as a person. He [shares his design and instructions](https://makezine.com/projects/hollow-2x4-project-enclosure/) on the Make Magazine site.

# Effects

Device users may have a variety of reactions to this 2x4 enclosure. First is likely some surprise because wooden enclosures are unusual and also kind of luxurious. But of course they are then struck by the warmth and solidity of the device, which is satisfying to hold in a way that most plastic box enclosures are not. Wood is malleable, customizable and extendable. Device owners may come to feel a sense of ownership and mastery once they realize they can mold the device easily to their liking, rather than adjusting their expectations to the preferences of some far-off manufacturer. The device itself operates more effectively as it is securely mounted and well-insulated from dirt, moisture or short-circuits.

# Elements

While it’s unlikely that Ben originally intended for his project to evoke the wabi-sabi aesthetic, there are many elements that bring it to mind. Wood is a natural material and unfinished 2x4 scraps often have knots, nicks and other flaws that remind us of its wild origin. It creates an organic form even when it is cut at right angles, and Ben has softened and rounded the edges in all his published examples. These wooden cases show the history of the tree they came from—as well as continuing to record their experiences as an enclosure, with accidental scars, scratches and dents from use adding to their beautiful imperfections. The scrap lumber has humble origins. Once can imagine Sen no Rikyu, the father of the Japanese tea ceremony, lauding these devices as showing the exquisite humility he sought from all of his rustic utensils. And let’s not forget these enclosures are fundamentally empty boxes, full of potential, that exemplify the potential power of the void, a Zen and wabi-sabi fundamental.

# Opportunities

Every wabi-sabi electronics project offers opportunities to take the aesthetic even further. Here are a few things to consider expanding on when building your own enclosures and devices.

1. In Jun'ichirō Tanizaki’s famous essay “[In Praise of Shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Shadows)” he writes “Were it not for shadows, there would be no beauty.” So think about using darker woods and rich varnishes to celebrate the subtle and obscure, creating interest for the eyes and mind.
2. Think about cambering and curving the surfaces to accentuate the organic material with more organic forms. For handheld devices, try modeling the shape so that it can be comfortably held, celebrating the user rather than the machine inside.
3. Perhaps 2x4 lumber feels too machined and organized. In that case raw wood, even a small log with the bark still on it, can be shaped into an electronics enclosure that evokes the untamed while still providing a shield for sensitive components. Even grasses could be woven into a shelter for your electronics, providing a rustic and unpretentious housing.
4. Fabrics and other surface treatments can bring warmth to your device. These will age faster than the wood, but can also be replaced when tattered without violating the wabi-sabi aesthetic. Consider the [Ise Shrine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-japanese-shrine-has-been-torn-down-and-rebuilt-every-20-years-for-the-past-millennium-575558/) in Japan that is rebuilt every 20 years but is still viewed as ancient.
5. Finally, remember to celebrate the natural variation present in your materials, as well as the dings and scars that it will gather as it lives out in the world. These imperfections are a delight to eyes weary of right angles and hearts longing for nuance.

# Building your own

Ben Light offers complete instructions for building your own 2x4 enclosures on [Make Magazine’s site](https://makezine.com/projects/hollow-2x4-project-enclosure/). Scrap lumber should be easy to find. In metric countries remember that lumber measurements have typically been converted from inches, and that all measurements are prior to planing so your piece will be smaller than its nominal size.  The project is suitable for beginners who are able to use power tools. The project could also be completed with hand tools plus a bit more effort, certainly doable and child-friendly! Your own wooden enclosures will bring a warmer experience to users of your electronic inventions, along with a suggestion of timeless permanence. Wood gets more beautiful with age and the collection of minor scars from everyday use—just like people!
